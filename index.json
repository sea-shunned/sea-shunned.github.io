Here, we introduce HAWKS, a new data generator that uses an evolutionary algorithm to evolve cluster structure of a synthetic data set. We demonstrate how such an approach can be used to produce datasets of a pre-specified difficulty, to trade off different aspects of problem difficulty, and how these interventions directly translate into changes in the clustering performance of established algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Evolving Controllably Difficult Datasets for Clustering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Cameron Shand**","[Richard Allmendinger](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/Richard.Allmendinger/)","[Julia Handl](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/Julia.Handl/)","John Keane"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531612800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531612800,"objectID":"42ccd8c0691304b1306243db63b40e99","permalink":"https://sea-shunned.github.io/publication/gecco-adaptive-mock/","publishdate":"2018-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gecco-adaptive-mock/","section":"publication","summary":"Existing encodings for evolutionary clustering strike different trade-offs between model and search complexity, limiting the applicability to data sets with particular properties or to problems of moderate size. We use the hypervolume to identify convergence, triggering a change in the search space, comparing different strategies to focus the optimization in this new space. The most successful strategies meet the clustering performance achieved for an optimal (a priori) setting of the hyperparameter, at a ~40% reduction of computational expense.","tags":null,"title":"Towards an Adaptive Encoding for Evolutionary Data Clustering","type":"publication"}]
